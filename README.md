## Project Description
This is my simple solution to the problem fresh graduates or people just moving into Lagos have when seeking accomodation, the web application I'm developing uses Machine Learning Model trained on data scraped from a website and makes price prediction based on a couple of deciding factors.

## Tech Stack
* NodeJs: The server side development is all NodeJs, from the web scraping to the sending of the gotten data via APIs.
* TensorFlow.js: This JavaScript library helps with the complete data to model process, from training, tuning and all.

## Live Site
Not Gotten yet, it's gonna be hosted on Netlify, with APIs on Heroku.
